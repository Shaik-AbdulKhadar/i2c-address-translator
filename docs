# Design Documentation: I²C Address Translator

## Architecture
- FPGA sits between **Master** and **Target**.
- Appears as slave at **Virtual Address (VA)**.
- Talks to target at **Real Address (RA)**.
- Data passes unchanged, only address is remapped.

## FSM
- **IDLE**: Wait for START.
- **ADDR**: Capture address byte.
- **TRANS**: Replace VA → RA.
- **WRITE**: Forward master → target data.
- **READ**: Forward target → master data.
- **STOP**: Reset to IDLE.

## Address Translation
Master sends `VA`. Translator intercepts and forwards `RA` to target device. ACK/NACK is preserved.

## Challenges
- Handling bidirectional SDA.
- Meeting I²C timing (100/400kHz).
- Clean FSM and open-drain logic for FPGA.
